Overall framework of the MCL-AHA model. MCL-AHA first constructs an invocation graph, a Mashup hypergraph, and a cloud API hypergraph. Node representations are learned via GNN and HGNN. Subsequently, multi-level contrastive learning is performed, comprising hypergraph contrastive learning (HCL) and cross-view contrastive learning (CVCL).
